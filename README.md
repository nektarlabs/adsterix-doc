# 👋 Welcome to Adsterix

**Adsterix** is a **market for social attention**, built on **Farcaster and Base**.

It enables **Farcaster-native, onchain ads** that turn social posts into monetizable ad units—without breaking context, trust, or user experience.

***

### 🧠 What is Adsterix?

Adsterix lets advertisers and developers trade attention directly:

* 🗨️ **Ads are Farcaster casts** — native social content, not banners
* ⛓️ **Onchain by design** — transparent, verifiable, and composable
* 🧩 **Embed anywhere** — miniapps, wallets, dashboards, or any interface
* 🔓 **Permissionless** — no approval, no platform lock-in

If you can render a cast, you can render an ad. 🚀

***

### 🤔 Why Adsterix?

Traditional ads interrupt.\
**Adsterix integrates.**

By using Farcaster-native casts as ads, Adsterix introduces a new primitive:

> 💡 **Social attention as an onchain asset**

Developers monetize surfaces they already have.\
Advertisers reach users where attention already lives. 🎯

### 👥 Who is it for?

* 👨‍💻 **Developers** monetizing miniapps, wallets, and tools
* 📣 **Advertisers** buying real social attention
* ✍️ **Creators** turning influence into onchain revenue
